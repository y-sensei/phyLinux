NXP PCA9532 LED (incl. GPIO) controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "nxp,pca9530", "nxp,pca9531", "nxp,pca9532", "nxp,pca9533"
- reg: I2C address
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells: Should be 2:
   1) pin number
   2) optional parameters:
      - bit 0 specifies polarity (0 for normal, 1 for inverted)
- nxp,typecodes: groups of 2 bits for each of the 16 pins:
  0: None
  1: LED
  2: Beep
  3: GPIO
- nxp,statecodes: groups of 2 bits for each of the 16 pins:
  0: off
  1: on
  2: pwm0
  3: pwm1

Optional properties:
- nxp,psc: array of 2 numbers: PSC values for the two PWM channels (see datasheet)
- nxp,pwm: array of 2 numbers: PWM values for the two PWM channels (see datasheet)

Properties for LED mode:
- #address-cells: Should be 1;
- #size-cells: Should be 0;
Each led is represented as a sub-node of the nsp,pca9532 device.

LED sub-node properties:
- label : (optional) see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- led-invert : set up led to work with inverted polarity. Works only
  with pins which typecode is 0x1 (see nxp,typecodes above).
- linux,default-trigger : (optional)
   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- reg : number of LED line (could be from 0 to 1 in pca9530, 0 to 3 in pca9533,
	0 to 7 in pca9531 or 0 to 15 in pca9532)

Example:

	pca9532: pca9532@60 {
		compatible = "nxp,pca9532";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		nxp,typecodes = <0xffffffff>;
		nxp,statecodes = <0x00000000>;
		reg = <0x60>;
	};

	sd@20098000 {
		wp-gpios = <&pca9532 5 0>;
		cd-gpios = <&pca9532 4 0>;
		cd-inverted;
		bus-width = <4>;
		status = "okay";
	};
